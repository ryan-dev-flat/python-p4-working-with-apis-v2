## Key Vocab

- **Request**: an attempt by one machine to contact another over the internet.
- **Client**: an application or machine that accesses services being provided by
  a server through the internet.
- **Web Server**: a combination of software and hardware that uses Hypertext
  Transfer Protocol (HTTP) and other protocols to respond to requests made over
  the internet.

## Define API

An API, or application programming interface, is a manner in which companies and
organizations, like Twitter or the New York City government, expose their data
and/or functionality to the public (i.e. talented programmers like yourself) for
use. APIs allow us to add important data and functionality to the applications
we build. Here's just a few examples of some of the cool things you can do by
using APIs:

- Create an app that allows users to sign up/sign in via
  Facebook/Google/Twitter/Github/etc.
- Use the NYC Open Data API to get and map data––everything from Health
  Department restaurant ratings to public park locations and hours to New York
  City Public Housing repair issues to noise complaints to public school
  construction, you name it!
- Use the Yelp API to find and deliver popular local spots to your users.
- Use the Weather Underground API to give your users up-to-date weather alerts.
- Use the Ticket Master API to inform your users if their favorite musician has
  an upcoming show.
- So much more!

This is just a small sample of what working with APIs allows us to do as
developers. Throughout the course of your programming life, you'll likely be
exposed to working with many different APIs. You'll even learn how to build your
own API later on in this course. This reading seeks to introduce the topic,
emphasize some of the benefits of getting comfortable working with APIs and
offer a brief intro into some of the common methods of working with APIs.

## How to Work with APIs

Different APIs expose their data and functionalities in different ways. However,
there are commonalities among them and there are common approaches that we'll
discuss here. Generally speaking, there are two main uses for APIs––getting data
and adding functionality (i.e. signing in with Facebook or posting to
Instagram). We'll be discussing the "getting data" part of working with APIs
here.

Many APIs are built on what is referred to as a REST-ful framework. That means
that the "endpoints", or URLs to which we can send a request for data, follow
certain conventions. These URLs should allow you to request information, send
information, update information and delete information. Let's focus on the
"getting information" request.

### Retrieving Data from an API

For this walk-through, we'll be working with the Open Library API.

Let's say we want to build an app where users can search for books and look up
information on them. We can make a custom request to the Open Library API for
the exact information we want to present to the user.

Check out the
[Open Library API documentation](https://openlibrary.org/dev/docs/api/search).
We will be using the [search API](https://openlibrary.org/dev/docs/api/search).

#### Finding the API Endpoint

Take a few minutes and familiarize yourself with the docs linked above. Learning
how to read API documentation is an important skill. It's okay if you don't
understand everything in the above document. For now, just look it over briefly.

As you read through, you'll see that the documentation lists the API endpoint.
**Endpoint** refers to the URL we can submit a request to and that will return
to us the desired data.

Open up a new tab in your browser and paste in the following URL:
`https://openlibrary.org/search.json?title=the+lord+of+the+rings`

The page brings you to is the desired set of data! Notice that the data is laid
out in what looks like a big list of nested dictionaries. This is actually a
[JSON](http://json.org/) object, which behaves just like a Python dictionary.
Working with the JSON data returned to you by requests to an API is one of the
reasons why we spent so much time in previous lessons learning how to manipulate
and operate on nested hashes.

For our app, we would like to show selected fields and a single book to our
users. We can use
[query parameters](https://www.semrush.com/blog/url-parameters/) to control the
response format. The above URL already has a query parameter called `title`. We
can add a `&` after the current URl to add more query parameters.

Open up a new tab again in your browser and paste in the following URL:
`https://openlibrary.org/search.json?title=the+lord+of+the+rings&fields=title,author_name&limit=1`

The above URL should return a much more manageable response. It should look like
the following:

```json
{
  "numFound": 522,
  "start": 0,
  "numFoundExact": true,
  "docs": [
    {
      "title": "The Lord of the Rings",
      "author_name": ["J.R.R. Tolkien"]
    }
  ],
  "num_found": 522,
  "q": "",
  "offset": null
}
```

**Top Tip:** Once you find the right URL for retrieving your data, test it out
directly in your browser _before_ you try to request the data from inside your
program. If pasting the URL into your browser brings you to the right data, you
can move on. This cuts down on debugging time. This way, once you try to request
the data from within your program, if it doesn't work, at least you'll know it's
something wrong with your code, as opposed to something wrong with the API.

#### Sending a Request to an API from a Program or Application

Now that we understand what an API is and have even dealt with a URL that takes
us to a real API endpoint, let's use that same URL to send a request for data
from a Python program. Fork and clone this repo locally.

Open up `lib/open_library_api.py`. Let's take a look at the code here:

```py
import requests
import json


class Search:

    def get_search_results(self):
        search_term = "the lord of the rings"

        search_term_formatted = search_term.replace(" ", "+")
        fields = ["title", "author_name"]
        # formats the list into a comma separated string
        # output: "title,author_name"
        fields_formatted = ",".join(fields)
        limit = 1

        URL = f"https://openlibrary.org/search.json?title={search_term_formatted}&fields={fields_formatted}&limit={limit}"

        response = requests.get(URL)
        return response.content

results = Search().get_search_results()
print(results)
```

The `requests` library allows your program or application to send HTTP requests.
In this case, we're using the `get` method with the `URL` argument to retrieve
data from the Open Library API.

We define a `get_search_results()` method that assigns our API endpoint to a
variable name `URL`. The method submits a request with that URL using the
`get()` method defined in the `requests` library, and returns the content of the
response.

Now, in your terminal in the directory of this lab, run
`python lib/open_library_api.py`. It should output the response from the NYC
Open Data API in a plaintext format:

```txt
b'{\n    "numFound": 522,\n    "start": 0,\n    "numFoundExact": true,\n    "docs": [\n        {\n            "title": "The Lord of the Rings",\n            "author_name": [\n                "J.R.R. Tolkien"\n            ]\n        }\n    ],\n    "num_found": 522,\n    "q": "",\n    "offset": null\n}'
```

### Working with API Data

Let's write a method called `get_search_results_json` that returns the response
formatted as JSON.

Copy and paste the following code into our Search class:

```py
def get_search_results_json(self):
    search_term = "the lord of the rings"

    search_term_formatted = search_term.replace(" ", "+")
    fields = ["title", "author_name"]
    fields_formatted = ",".join(fields)
    limit = 1

    URL = f"https://openlibrary.org/search.json?title={search_term_formatted}&fields={fields_formatted}&limit={limit}"
    print(URL)
    response = requests.get(URL)
    return response.json()
```

At the bottom of the file, comment out:

```py
results_json = Search().get_search_results_json()
# json.dumps formats the JSON object in a human readable format
print(json.dumps(results_json, indent=1))
```

Now, run the program with `python lib/open_library_api.py` in your terminal. You
should see something like this:

```json
{
  "numFound": 522,
  "start": 0,
  "numFoundExact": true,
  "docs": [
    {
      "title": "The Lord of the Rings",
      "author_name": ["J.R.R. Tolkien"]
    }
  ],
  "num_found": 522,
  "q": "",
  "offset": null
}
```

We have also provided a `get_user_search_results` method so you can experiment
with using user input to create dynamic queries.

## Solution

The final version of `open_library_api.py`:

```py
import requests
import json


class Search:

    def get_search_results(self):
        search_term = "the lord of the rings"

        search_term_formatted = search_term.replace(" ", "+")
        fields = ["title", "author_name"]
        # formats the list into a comma separated string
        # output: "title,author_name"
        fields_formatted = ",".join(fields)
        limit = 1

        URL = f"https://openlibrary.org/search.json?title={search_term_formatted}&fields={fields_formatted}&limit={limit}"

        response = requests.get(URL)
        return response.content

    def get_search_results_json(self):
        search_term = "the lord of the rings"

        search_term_formatted = search_term.replace(" ", "+")
        fields = ["title", "author_name"]
        fields_formatted = ",".join(fields)
        limit = 1

        URL = f"https://openlibrary.org/search.json?title={search_term_formatted}&fields={fields_formatted}&limit={limit}"
        print(URL)
        response = requests.get(URL)
        return response.json()

    def get_user_search_results(self, search_term):
        search_term_formatted = search_term.replace(" ", "+")
        fields = ["title", "author_name"]
        fields_formatted = ",".join(fields)
        limit = 1

        URL = f"https://openlibrary.org/search.json?title={search_term_formatted}&fields={fields_formatted}&limit={limit}"

        response = requests.get(URL).json()
        response_formatted = f"Title: {response['docs'][0]['title']}\nAuthor: {response['docs'][0]['author_name'][0]}"
        return response_formatted


# results = Search().get_search_results()
# print(results)

# results_json = Search().get_search_results_json()
# print(json.dumps(results_json, indent=1))

search_term = input("Enter a book title: ")
result = Search().get_user_search_results(search_term)
print("Search Result:\n")
print(result)

```

## Conclusion

To recap: APIs generally either provide a user with data or added functionality.
We can use APIs that serve data to get information for our own applications and
projects. To get this data, we need to send a request to the URL of the API and
know how to work with the response we receive. Many APIs serve data in JSON
format, which needs to be parsed before we can use it. Once parsed, it becomes a
dictionary we can work with and extract data from.

In our example, we were able to retrieve remote information from an API using
the `requests` library. By putting this implementation inside a class, we can
develop highly reusable code that lets us access all sorts of information
remotely.

Always make sure to read the API docs and experiment with queries in the browser
or in the Python REPL before writing out custom classes.
